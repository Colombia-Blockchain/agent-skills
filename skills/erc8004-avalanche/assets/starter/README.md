# ERC-8004 Agent — Starter Template

Create your own AI agent on Avalanche in 5 minutes.

---

## Prerequisites (What You Need First)

Before starting, make sure you have these installed on your computer:

| Tool | What is it? | How to install |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Node.js** (v18+) | Runs JavaScript/TypeScript code on your computer | [nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download) — download and run the installer |
| **Git** | Tracks changes in your code and uploads to GitHub | [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) — download and run the installer |
| **A code editor** | Where you write and edit code | [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (free, recommended) |
| **A GitHub account** | Where your code lives online | [github.com](https://github.com/) — sign up for free |
| **A crypto wallet** | Needed to register your agent on Avalanche | [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) — install the browser extension |

To verify Node.js and Git are installed, open your **Terminal** (Mac) or **Command Prompt** (Windows) and type:

```bash
node --version    # Should show v18 or higher
git --version     # Should show a version number
```

> **What is a Terminal?** It's the app where you type commands. On Mac: search "Terminal" in Spotlight. On Windows: search "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell" in Start.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (downloads the libraries your agent needs)
npm install

# 2. Run locally (starts the agent on your computer)
npm run dev

# 3. Open in browser
open http://localhost:3000
```

Your agent is running! You should see the dashboard.

## Test Your Endpoints

```bash
# Dashboard (visual page)
curl http://localhost:3000/

# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Registration metadata
curl http://localhost:3000/registration.json

# MCP — list available tools
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}'

# MCP — call a tool
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/call","id":2,"params":{"name":"ping","arguments":{"message":"hello"}}}'
```

## Customize Your Agent

1. Edit `registration.json` — change name, description, capabilities
2. Edit `src/server.ts` — add your own MCP tools and API endpoints
3. Replace `public/agent.png` with your agent's image (recommended: 512x512 PNG)
4. Edit `dashboard.html` to customize the visual page

## Deploy to Railway

Railway is a hosting service that puts your agent online so anyone can access it.

1. Create a repository on [github.com](https://github.com/) and push your code:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "My first ERC-8004 agent"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
2. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) → sign up with GitHub → New Project → Deploy from GitHub
3. Select your repository. Railway auto-detects the Dockerfile and deploys
4. Get your public URL (e.g., `https://my-agent-production.up.railway.app`)
5. Update all `YOUR-DOMAIN` in `registration.json` with your Railway URL and push again

## Register On-Chain

This step gives your agent an official identity on the Avalanche blockchain (like an ID card).

```bash
# Install Foundry (command-line tool for blockchain interaction)
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash && foundryup

# Get test AVAX from faucet (free test tokens)
# Visit: https://faucet.avax.network

# Register on Fuji testnet
export PRIVATE_KEY="your-private-key"
cast send 0x8004A818BFB912233c491871b3d84c89A494BD9e \
  "register(string)" \
  "https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL/registration.json" \
  --rpc-url https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

> **Where do I get my private key?** In MetaMask: click the three dots → Account details → Show private key. **NEVER share this key with anyone.**

After registering, you'll get an `agentId`. Update `registration.json` with it and redeploy.

## Glossary

| Term | Simple explanation |
|------|--------------------|
| **Agent** | A program that runs online and can do tasks automatically (answer questions, provide data, etc.) |
| **Avalanche** | A blockchain network (like Ethereum but faster and cheaper). Where your agent gets its identity |
| **AVAX** | The cryptocurrency of Avalanche. You need a tiny amount to register your agent |
| **Blockchain** | A public digital record that nobody can alter. Used here to give your agent a verified identity |
| **cast** | A command-line tool (from Foundry) to interact with blockchains |
| **curl** | A command to make web requests from the terminal. Like visiting a URL without a browser |
| **Dashboard** | The visual web page that shows your agent's info when someone visits its URL |
| **Deploy** | To put your code on a server so it's accessible to everyone on the internet |
| **Docker / Dockerfile** | A way to package your app so it runs the same everywhere. Railway uses it automatically |
